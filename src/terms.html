	materials that we do not own or control may be transmitted, stored,
	accessed or otherwise made available using the App. Channel Factory
	has in place certain legally mandated procedures regarding
	allegations of copyright infringement occurring on the App. Channel
	Factory has adopted a policy that provides for the immediate removal
	of any content or the suspension of any user that is found to have
	infringed on the rights of Channel Factory or of a third party, or
	that has otherwise violated any intellectual property laws or
	regulations, or any of the terms and conditions of this Agreement.
	If you believe any material available via the App infringes a
	copyright, you should notify us using the notice procedure for
	claimed infringement under the DMCA (17 U.S.C. Sect. 512(c)(2)). We
	will respond expeditiously to remove or disable access to the
	material claimed to be infringing and will follow the procedures
	specified in the DMCA to resolve the claim between the notifying
